                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more
                    so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                    “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
                    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                    for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                    The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                    the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
                    startup. ”

                    “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure
                    from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
                    enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                    The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never
                    had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
                    It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact,
                    I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
                    certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.”

                    Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from
